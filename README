OpenCPI Project Containing Xilinx 2018.2 Software Platform

This project contains the OpenCPI Software Platform to support cross-compilation
of OpenCPI and its workers for use with Xilinx's 2018.2 distribution of Linux.

See branch release_1.4_zynq_ultra of https://github.com/Geontech/bsp_zcu1xx for
use cases of this SW platform on Xilinx's ZCU102 and ZCU111 Evaluation Boards.
The ZCU102/ZCU111 Getting Started Guides in that repository provide instructions
for setting up an SD card for use with this SW platform.
